    Implements the public interface for the ProPublica Congress API
    
    Methods are namespaced by topic (though some have multiple access points).
    Everything returns decoded JSON, with fat trimmed.
    
    In addition, the top-level namespace is itself a client, which
    can be used to fetch generic resources, using the API URIs included
    in responses. This is here so you don't have to write separate
    functions that add on your API key and trim fat off responses.
    
    Create a new instance with your API key, or set an environment
    variable called ``PROPUBLICA_API_KEY``.
    
    Congress uses `httplib2 <https://github.com/httplib2/httplib2>`_, and caching is pluggable. By default,
    it uses `httplib2.FileCache <https://httplib2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/libhttplib2.html#httplib2.FileCache>`_, 
    in a directory called ``.cache``, but it should also work with memcache 
    or anything else that exposes the same interface as FileCache (per httplib2 docs).
